Overview
This Docker container makes it easy to get an instance of Jira Software, Service Management or Core up and running.

Note: ** Jira Software will be referenced in the examples provided. **

** Use docker version >= 20.10.10 **

Quick Start
For the JIRA_HOME directory that is used to store application data (amongst other things) we recommend mounting a host directory as a data volume, or via a named volume.

Additionally, if running Jira in Data Center mode it is required that a shared filesystem is mounted. The mountpoint (inside the container) can be configured with JIRA_SHARED_HOME.

To get started you can use a data volume, or named volumes. In this example we'll use named volumes.

docker volume create --name jiraVolume
docker run -v jiraVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira --name="jira" -d -p 8080:8080 atlassian/jira-software
Success. Jira is now available on http://localhost:8080*

Please ensure your container has the necessary resources allocated to it. We recommend 2GiB of memory allocated to accommodate the application server. See System Requirements for further information.

* Note: If you are using docker-machine on Mac OS X, please use open http://$(docker-machine ip default):8080 instead.

Configuring Jira
This Docker image is intended to be configured from its environment; the provided information is used to generate the application configuration files from templates. This allows containers to be repeatably created and destroyed on-the-fly, as required in advanced cluster configurations. Most aspects of the deployment can be configured in this manner; the necessary environment variables are documented below. However, if your particular deployment scenario is not covered by these settings, it is possible to override the provided templates with your own; see the section Advanced Configuration below.

Memory / Heap Size
If you need to override Jira's default memory allocation, you can control the minimum heap (Xms) and maximum heap (Xmx) via the below environment variables.

JVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY (default: 384m)

The minimum heap size of the JVM

JVM_MAXIMUM_MEMORY (default: 768m)

The maximum heap size of the JVM

JVM_RESERVED_CODE_CACHE_SIZE (default: 512m)

The reserved code cache size of the JVM

Reverse Proxy Settings
If Jira is run behind a reverse proxy server (e.g. a load-balancer or nginx server) as described here, then you need to specify extra options to make Jira aware of the setup. They can be controlled via the below environment variables.

ATL_PROXY_NAME (default: NONE)

The reverse proxy's fully qualified hostname. CATALINA_CONNECTOR_PROXYNAME is also supported for backwards compatability.

ATL_PROXY_PORT (default: NONE)

The reverse proxy's port number via which Jira is accessed. CATALINA_CONNECTOR_PROXYPORT is also supported for backwards compatability.

ATL_TOMCAT_PORT (default: 8080)

The port for Tomcat/Jira to listen on. Depending on your container deployment method this port may need to be exposed and published.

ATL_TOMCAT_SCHEME (default: http)

The protocol via which Jira is accessed. CATALINA_CONNECTOR_SCHEME is also supported for backwards compatability.

ATL_TOMCAT_SECURE (default: false)

Set 'true' if ATL_TOMCAT_SCHEME is 'https'. CATALINA_CONNECTOR_SECURE is also supported for backwards compatability.

ATL_TOMCAT_CONTEXTPATH (default: NONE)

The context path the application is served over. CATALINA_CONTEXT_PATH is also supported for backwards compatability.

The following Tomcat/Catalina options are also supported. For more information, see https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/index.html.

ATL_TOMCAT_MGMT_PORT (default: 8005)
ATL_TOMCAT_MAXTHREADS (default: 100)
ATL_TOMCAT_MINSPARETHREADS (default: 10)
ATL_TOMCAT_CONNECTIONTIMEOUT (default: 20000)
ATL_TOMCAT_ENABLELOOKUPS (default: false)
ATL_TOMCAT_PROTOCOL (default: HTTP/1.1)
ATL_TOMCAT_ACCEPTCOUNT (default: 10)
ATL_TOMCAT_MAXHTTPHEADERSIZE (default: 8192)
JVM configuration
If you need to pass additional JVM arguments to Jira, such as specifying a custom trust store, you can add them via the below environment variable

JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS

Additional JVM arguments for Jira

Example:

docker run -e JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/var/atlassian/application-data/jira/cacerts -v jiraVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira --name="jira" -d -p 8080:8080 atlassian/jira-software
Jira-specific settings
ATL_AUTOLOGIN_COOKIE_AGE (default: 1209600; two weeks, in seconds)

The maximum time a user can remain logged-in with 'Remember Me'.

Database configuration
It is optionally possible to configure the database from the environment, avoiding the need to do so through the web startup screen.

The following variables are all must all be supplied if using this feature:

ATL_JDBC_URL

The database URL; this is database-specific.

ATL_JDBC_USER

The database user to connect as.

ATL_JDBC_PASSWORD

The password for the database user.

ATL_DB_DRIVER

The JDBC driver class; supported drivers are:

com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
org.postgresql.Driver
The driver must match the DB type (see next entry).

ATL_DB_TYPE

The type of database; valid supported values are:

mssql
mysql
mysql57
mysql8
oracle10g
postgres72
Note that mysql is only supported for versions prior to 8.13, and mysql57 and mysql8 are only supported after. See the 8.13.x upgrade instructions for details.

The following variables may be optionally supplied when configuring the database from the environment:

ATL_DB_SCHEMA_NAME

The schema name of the database. Depending on the value of ATL_DB_TYPE, the following default values are used if no schema name is specified:

mssql: dbo
mysql: NONE
mysql57: NONE
mysql8: NONE
oracle10g: NONE
postgres72: public
Note: Due to licensing restrictions Jira does not ship with MySQL or Oracle JDBC drivers. To use these databases you will need to copy a suitable driver into the container and restart it. For example, to copy the MySQL driver into a container named "jira", you would do the following:

docker cp mysql-connector-java.x.y.z.jar jira:/opt/atlassian/jira/lib
docker restart jira
For more information see the page Startup check: JIRA database driver missing.

Data Center configuration
This docker image can be run as part of a Data Center cluster. You can specify the following properties to start Jira as a Data Center node, instead of manually configuring a cluster.properties file, See Installing Jira Data Center for more information on each property and its possible configuration.

Cluster configuration
Jira Software and Jira Service Management only

CLUSTERED (default: false)

Set 'true' to enable clustering configuration to be used. This will create a cluster.properties file inside the container's $JIRA_HOME directory.

JIRA_NODE_ID (default: jira_node_

The unique ID for the node. By default, this includes a randomly generated ID unique to each container, but can be overridden with a custom value.

JIRA_SHARED_HOME (default: $JIRA_HOME/shared)

The location of the shared home directory for all Jira nodes. Note: This must be real shared filesystem that is mounted inside the container. Additionally, see the note about UIDs.

EHCACHE_PEER_DISCOVERY (default: default)

Describes how nodes find each other.

EHCACHE_LISTENER_HOSTNAME (default: NONE)

The hostname of the current node for cache communication. Jira Data Center will resolve this this internally if the parameter isn't set.

EHCACHE_LISTENER_PORT (default: 40001)

The port the node is going to be listening to. Depending on your container deployment method this port may need to be exposed and published.

EHCACHE_OBJECT_PORT (default: dynamic)

The port number on which the remote objects bound in the registry receive calls. This defaults to a free port if not specified. This port may need to be exposed and published.

EHCACHE_LISTENER_SOCKETTIMEOUTMILLIS (default: 2000)

The default timeout for the Ehcache listener.

EHCACHE_MULTICAST_ADDRESS (default: NONE)

A valid multicast group address. Required when EHCACHE_PEER_DISCOVERY is set to 'automatic' instead of 'default'.

EHCACHE_MULTICAST_PORT (default: NONE)

The dedicated port for the multicast heartbeat traffic. Required when EHCACHE_PEER_DISCOVERY is set to 'automatic' instead of 'default'. Depending on your container deployment method this port may need to be exposed and published.

EHCACHE_MULTICAST_TIMETOLIVE (default: NONE)

A value between 0 and 255 which determines how far the packets will propagate. Required when EHCACHE_PEER_DISCOVERY is set to 'automatic' instead of 'default'.

EHCACHE_MULTICAST_HOSTNAME (default: NONE)

The hostname or IP of the interface to be used for sending and receiving multicast packets. Required when EHCACHE_PEER_DISCOVERY is set to 'automatic' instead of 'default'.

Shared directory and user IDs
By default the Jira application runs as the user jira, with a UID and GID of 2001. Consequently this UID must have write access to the shared filesystem. If for some reason a different UID must be used, there are a number of options available:

The Docker image can be rebuilt with a different UID.
Under Linux, the UID can be remapped using user namespace remapping.
To preserve strict permissions for certain configuration files, this container starts as root to perform bootstrapping before running Jira under a non-privileged user account. If you wish to start the container as a non-root user, please note that Tomcat configuration will be skipped and a warning will be logged. You may still apply custom configuration in this situation by mounting a custom server.xml file directly to /opt/atlassian/jira/conf/server.xml

Database and Clustering bootstrapping will work as expected when starting this container as a non-root user.

Container configuration
ATL_FORCE_CFG_UPDATE (default: false)

The Docker entrypoint generates application configuration on first start; not all of these files are regenerated on subsequent starts. This is deliberate, to avoid race conditions or overwriting manual changes during restarts and upgrades. However in deployments where configuration is purely specified through the environment (e.g. Kubernetes) this behaviour may be undesirable; this flag forces an update of all generated files.

In Jira the affected files are: dbconfig.xml

See the entrypoint code for the details of how configuration files are generated.

SET_PERMISSIONS (default: true)

Define whether to set home directory permissions on startup. Set to false to disable this behaviou
